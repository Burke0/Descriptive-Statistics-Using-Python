# The upper-left quadrant displays the number of true negatives. The number of people that were not lying down that the model accurately predicted were not lying down.
# The bottom-left quadrant displays the number of false negatives. The number of people that were lying down that the model inaccurately predicted were not lying down.
# The upper-right quadrant displays the number of false positives. The number of people that were not lying down that the model inaccurately predicted were lying down.
# The bottom-right quadrant displays the number of true positives. The number of people that were lying down that the model accurately predicted were lying down.
# A perfect model would yield all true negatives and true positives, and no false negatives or false positives.
