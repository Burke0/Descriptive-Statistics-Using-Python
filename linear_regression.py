##### Finish checking model assumptions #####
#############################################

# 1) Linearity (The scatterplot matrix satisfied this assumption)
# 2) Independent observations (There is no reason to believe that one penguin's body mass or bill length would be related to any other penguin's anatomical measurements)
# 3) Normality
# 4) Homoscedasticity

# Normality - we must check residuals, as an approximation of the errors

# Subset X variable
X = ols_data[["bill_length_mm"]]

# Get predictions from model
fitted_values = model.predict(X)

# Calculate residuals
residuals = model.resid

# We can create a histogram of the residuals to visually check for normality
# Since the residuals are close to normal distribution, the assumtion is met.

fig = sns.histplot(residuals)
fig.set_xlabel("Residual Value")
fig.set_title("Histogram of Residuals(Penguin dataset model)")
plt.show()

# another way is check a Q-Q plot for a straight diagonal line starting from the bottom left corner(shows normal distribution)
fig = sm.qqplot(model.resid, line = 's')
plt.show()

# To confirm we can perform the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
shapiro_test_statistic, shapiro_p_value = shapiro(residuals)

    print("Residuals appear to be normally distributed (p > 0.05).")
else:
    print("Residuals do not appear to be normally distributed (p â‰¤ 0.05).")


# Homoscedasticity - To check the homoscedasticity assumption, we can create a scatterplot of the fitted values and residuals. 
# If the plot resembles a random cloud (i.e., the residuals are scattered randomly), then the assumption is likely met.
