# 1) Is the mean AQI in Los Angeles County is statistically different from the rest of California?
# 2) Does New York have a lower AQI than Ohio?
# 3) A new policy will affect those states with a mean AQI of 10 or greater. Will Michigan be affected by this new policy?

# With a p-value (0.049) being less than 0.05 (as your significance level is 5%), reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

# Task 2: Does New York have a lower AQI than Ohio?

# ùêª0: The mean AQI of New York is greater than or equal to that of Ohio.
# ùêªùê¥: The mean AQI of New York is below that of Ohio.

# With a p-value (0.030) of less than 0.05 (as your significance level is 5%) and a t-statistic < 0 (-2.036), 
# reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

# Task 3: A new policy will affect those states with a mean AQI of 10 or greater. Will Michigan be affected by this new policy?

# ùêª0: The mean AQI of Michigan is less than or equal to 10.
# ùêªùê¥: The mean AQI of Michigan is greater than 10.

# With a p-value (0.940) being greater than 0.05 (as your significance level is 5%)
# and a t-statistic < 0 (-1.74), 
# fail to reject the null hypothesis.

# Results:
# (At a 95% confidence level):
    # 1) The AQI in Los Angeles County was in fact different from the rest of California.
    # 2) New York has a lower AQI than Ohio based on the results.
    # 3) It can't be  concluded that the mean AQI is greater than 10. Thus, it is unlikely that Michigan would be affected by the new policy.
