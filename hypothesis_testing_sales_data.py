# R-squared
# Using TV as the independent variable results in a linear regression model with ùëÖ2=0.874. 
# In other words, the model explains 87.4% of the variation in Sales. 
# This makes the model an effective predictor of Sales. 

# coefficient estimates
# The default TV category for the model is High, because there are coefficients for the other two TV categories, Medium and Low. 
# According to the model, Sales with a Medium or Low TV category are lower on average than Sales with a High TV category. 
# For example, the model predicts that a Low TV promotion would be 208.813 (in millions of dollars) lower in Sales on average than a High TV promotion.

# The p-value for all coefficients is 0.000, meaning all coefficients are statistically significant at ùëù=0.05. 
# The 95% confidence intervals for each coefficient should be reported when presenting results to stakeholders. 
# For instance, there is a 95% chance the interval [‚àí215.353,‚àí202.274] contains the true parameter of the slope of ùõΩùëáùëâùêøùëúùë§,
# which is the estimated difference in promotion sales when a Low TV promotion is chosen instead of a High TV promotion.

# improvements
# Given how accurate TV was as a predictor, the model could be improved with a more granular view of the TV promotions, such as additional categories or the actual TV promotion budgets. 
# Further, additional variables, such as the location of the marketing campaign or the time of year, may increase model accuracy. 

# Create an one-way ANOVA table for the fit model to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in Sales among groups. 
# The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in Sales based on the TV promotion budget.
# The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in Sales based on the TV promotion budget.
sm.stats.anova_lm(model, typ=2)

# The F-test statistic is 1971.46 and the p-value is 8.81‚àó10‚àí256 (i.e., very small). 
# Because the p-value is less than 0.05, you would reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in Sales based on the TV promotion budget.
# The results of the one-way ANOVA test indicate that you can reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. 
# There is a statistically significant difference in Sales among TV groups.

# Perform the Tukey's HSD post hoc test to compare if there is a significant difference between each pair of categories for TV.
tukey_oneway = pairwise_tukeyhsd(endog = data["Sales"], groups = data["TV"])

# Display the results
print(tukey_oneway.summary())

# The first row, which compares the High and Low TV groups, 
# indicates that you can reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the Sales of these two groups.
# You can also reject the null hypotheses for the two other pairwise comparisons that compare High to Medium and Low to Medium.
# Sales is not the same between any pair of TV groups. 

# stakeholder report: 
'''High TV promotion budgets result in significantly more sales than both medium and low TV promotion budgets. Medium TV promotion budgets result in significantly more sales than low TV promotion budgets.

Specifically, following are estimates for the difference between the mean sales resulting from different pairs of TV promotions, as determined by the Tukey's HSD test:

    Estimated difference between the mean sales resulting from High and Low TV promotions: $208.81 million (with 95% confidence that the exact value for this difference is between 200.99 and 216.64 million dollars).
    Estimated difference between the mean sales resulting from High and Medium TV promotions: $101.51 million (with 95% confidence that the exact value for this difference is between 93.69 and 109.32 million dollars).
    difference between the mean sales resulting from Medium and Low TV promotions: $107.31 million (with 95% confidence that the exact value for this difference is between 99.71 and 114.91 million dollars).

The linear regression model estimating Sales from TV had an R-squared of $0.871, making it a fairly accurate estimator. The model showed a statistically significant relationship between the TV promotion budget and Sales.

The results of the one-way ANOVA test indicate that the null hypothesis that there is no difference in Sales based on the TV promotion budget can be rejected. Through the ANOVA post hoc test, a significant difference between all pairs of TV promotions was found.

The difference in the distribution of sales across TV promotions was determined significant by both a one-way ANOVA test and a Tukey‚Äôs HSD test.'''
